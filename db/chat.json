In the past, I wasn't able to own this about myself. However, while I lived in New York City I adopted the mantra, 'own it'. I feel like for anyone trying to get anyone to do anything (via power or influence), if you can't show that you are the most bought in person to your own vision, how can you expect anyone to follow. I think leadership starts with leading one's self.",

I can be vulnerable, and really internalize and apply valuable feedback. But most of all, I am endlessly curious. The thirst to innovate is what ultimately allows me to help shape what we think is possible with technology.",
